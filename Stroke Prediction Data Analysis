-- Programming tools used: SQL (PostgreSQL & pgAdmin 4)
-- Note: This public dataset was retrieved from Kaggle
at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

-- Context: This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like
gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.

-- Attribute information:
1) id: unique identifier
2) gender: 'Male', 'Female', or 'Other'
3) age: age of the patient
4) hypertension: 0 if the patient does not have hypertension, 1 if the patient does have hypertension
5) heart_disease: 0 if the patient does not have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient does have a heart disease
6) ever_married: 'No', or 'Yes'
7) work_type: 'children', 'govt_job', 'never_worked', 'private', or 'self-employed'
8) residence_type: 'rural', or 'urban'
9) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
10) bmi: body mass index
11) smoking_status: 'formerly smoked', 'never smoked', 'smokes', or 'unknown'
12) stroke: 0 if the patient has not had a stroke, 1 if the patient has had a stroke

- There are 201 null values in the bmi data column.

/ * Replacing null values */

- I will replace the null values in the bmi column with the avg bmi of the entire dataset.

- Query to find avg bmi:

---------------------
28.8932369117946629

- Query to replace the null values with 28.9 (the avg bmi):

UPDATE stroke_data
SET bmi = '28.9'
WHERE bmi IS NULL;

UPDATE 201

/* What percentage of males in this dataset had a stroke? */

SELECT gender, count(gender),

GROUP BY gender;

gender | count |     percentage
--------+-------+--------------------
Male   |   108 | 5.1063829787234043

- The result shows that about 5.1% of the males in the dataset have had a stroke.

/* What percentage of females in this dataset had a stroke? */

SELECT gender, count(gender),
(COUNT(gender) * 100.0) / (SELECT count(gender) FROM stroke_data WHERE gender = 'Female')
AS percentage FROM stroke_data
WHERE stroke = '1' and gender = 'Female'
GROUP BY gender;

gender | count |     percentage
--------+-------+--------------------
Female |   141 | 4.7094188376753507

- The result shows that about 4.7% of the females in the dataset have had a stroke.

/* Does age have an influence on stroke? */

SELECT age, COUNT(age)
AS age_count
FROM stroke_data
WHERE stroke = 1
GROUP BY age
ORDER BY age_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

age | age_count

 74 |         9
 68 |         9
 82 |         9
 63 |         9

- The above query result is limited to 10 rows.
- We can see that patients with an age over 55 in the dataset are the majority that have had a stroke.

SELECT count(age),
(SELECT avg(age) FROM stroke_data) AS avg_age_all_patients,
(SELECT avg(age) FROM stroke_data WHERE stroke = '0') AS avg_age_no_stroke,
(SELECT avg(age) FROM stroke_data WHERE stroke = '1') AS avg_age_stroke

count | avg_age_all_patients |  avg_age_no_stroke  |   avg_age_stroke
-------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------
 5110 |  43.2266144814090020 | 41.9715449495988480 | 67.7281927710843373

 - The average age of all of the patients in the dataset is about 43
 - The average age of patients that have not had a stroke is about 42
 - The average age of patients that have had a stroke is about 68
 - These results prove that there is a correlation between age and stroke.

 /* Does BMI have an influence on stroke? */

- Note: The guide for BMI according to National Institute of Health (NIH):
        Less than 18.5 is underweight
        Between 18.5 and 24.9 is ideal
        Between 25 and 29.9 is overweight
        More than 30 is obesity

SELECT count(bmi),
(SELECT avg(bmi) FROM stroke_data) AS avg_bmi_all_patients,
(SELECT avg(bmi) FROM stroke_data WHERE stroke = '0') AS avg_bmi_no_stroke,
(SELECT avg(bmi) FROM stroke_data WHERE stroke = '1') AS avg_bmi_stroke
FROM stroke_data;

count | avg_bmi_all_patients |  avg_bmi_no_stroke  |   avg_bmi_stroke
-------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------
 5110 |  28.8935029354207436 | 28.8256120139888912 | 30.2188755020080321

 - The average bmi of all of the patients in the dataset is about 28.89
 - The average bmi of patients that have not had a stroke is about 28.82
 - The average bmi of patients that have had a stroke is about 30.47
 - These results prove that there is a correlation between bmi and stroke.

/* Further analyzing BMI */

- How many patients that have had a stroke are in each category of BMI (underweight, ideal, overweight, and obese)?

SELECT count(bmi) AS total_count,
(SELECT count(bmi) FROM stroke_data WHERE stroke = '1') AS stroke_count,
(SELECT count(bmi) FROM stroke_data WHERE stroke = '1' AND bmi <= 18.5) AS bmi_underweight,
(SELECT count(bmi) FROM stroke_data WHERE stroke = '1' AND (bmi >= 18.5 AND bmi <= 24.9)) AS bmi_ideal,
(SELECT count(bmi) FROM stroke_data WHERE stroke = '1' AND (bmi >= 25.0 AND bmi <= 29.9)) AS bmi_overweight,
(SELECT count(bmi) FROM stroke_data WHERE stroke = '1' AND bmi >= 30.0) AS bmi_obese
FROM stroke_data;

total_count | stroke_count | bmi_underweight | bmi_ideal | bmi_overweight | bmi_obese
-------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+----------------+-----------
       5110 |          249 |               1 |        35 |            115 |        98

 - Patients that have had a stroke are primarily in the overweight and obese category.

 / * Measuring the correlation between 2 variables */

 - Note: In order to do this, I will find the r value.
         r value 0 means no relationship
         r value .01 to .29 means a weak relationship
         r value .30 to .59 means a moderate relationship
         r value .60 to .99 means a strong to nearly perfect relationship
         r value 1.0 means a perfect relationship

 - I will measure the relationship between bmi and average glucose level in patients that have had a stroke for this example.

 SELECT corr(avg_glucose_level, bmi)
 AS bmi_glucose_r
 FROM stroke_data
 WHERE stroke = 1;

bmi_glucose_r
---------------------
0.31572857902914603

- This result shows that there is a moderate relationship between bmi and glucose levels.

/* Predicting values with regression analysis */

- Note: In order to do this, I will find the regression slope and y intercept.

SELECT
round(regr_slope(avg_glucose_level, bmi)::numeric, 2) AS slope,
round(regr_intercept(avg_glucose_level, bmi)::numeric, 2) AS y_intercept
FROM stroke_data
WHERE stroke = 1;

slope | y_intercept
-------+-------------
 3.36 |       31.13

- From this result we can predict that for every one-unit increase in bmi, we can expect a patient's glucose level to increase by 3.36.

/* Finding the effect of an independent variable with r-squared */

SELECT round(
regr_r2(avg_glucose_level, bmi)::numeric, 3
) AS r_squared
FROM stroke_data
WHERE stroke = 1;

r_squared
-----------
    0.100

- The r-squared value of 0.100 indicates that about 10 percent of the variation in glucose levels in patients that have had a stroke can be explained by bmi.
